# Minesweeper

## About
I'm unfamiliar with python and was using this minesweeper game as a way to familiarize myself with the language.

## Changes
v.2 - Tldr: I hated the first version and started over.
    - I changed out my graphics version with a text version of Minesweeper. Admittedly, I was so upset with the way I designed the graphics version that I decided to scrap it and start over. The new Minesweeper.py is a lot cleaner to work with and should be easy to implement graphics in the future. The old version was designed around the graphics and how it would look, then I sort of threw in a way to handle to data. The resulting code was ugly and would scale horribly. 

## Versions
v.2 - Minesweeper with text (now Minesweeper.py)
v.1 - Minesweeper with graphics (now MinesweeperOld.py)

## Future Plans
I'm hoping to use this as a basis for a machine learning implementation in the future.
